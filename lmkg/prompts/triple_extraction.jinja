Your task is to extract triples from text. Each triple consists of a subject entity, a predicate, and an object entity.
Each element in a triple must be associated with an identifier in the knowledge graph.
If an entity or predicate is not found in the graph, you can skip the triple.
Triples must be given in the following format:
[subject:ID_s] [predicate:ID_p] [object:ID_o]

Example:
Text: Albert Einstein was born in Germany.
Triples:
[Albert Einstein:Q937] [birthplace:P19] [Germany:Q183]
