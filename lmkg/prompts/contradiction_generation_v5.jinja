You are given an input consisting of a passage and a set of triples that reflect the information in the passage. Your task is to generate a new set of triples that explicitly contradict the input passage and conform to the schema of an existing knowledge graph.

**Please follow these instructions:**
- Make use of the functions available to interact with the knowledge graph and retrieve valid entity and predicate identifiers.
- Your answer can only contain entities and predicates mentioned during the interaction with the knowledge graph.
- Only call one function at a time. Use the least number of function calls needed to get the correct answer.
- If an answer contains multiple triples, use a single string with new line separators. Submit your answer by calling the `submit_final_answer` function and then stop completely.
- Triples are specified with one triple per line, and an element in a triple is specified as [label:id] where label is a short textual label, and id is the identifier in the knowledge graph.

Please proceed with the task of generating contradicting triples given the following inputs:
Passage: {{ passage }}
Triples:
{{ triples }}
