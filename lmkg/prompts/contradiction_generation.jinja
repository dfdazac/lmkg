You are given an input consisting of a passage and a set of triples that reflect the information in the passage. Your task is to generate a new set of triples that contradict the input. Please follow these instructions:
- Make sure to use only identifiers of entities and predicates that exist in the knowledge graph when generating the contradicting triples.
- Make use of the functions available to you to solve the problem.
- Triples are specified with one triple per line, and an element in a triple is specified as [label:id] where label is a short textual label, and id is the identifier in the knowledge graph
- Only call one function at a time.
- Submit your answer by calling the `submit_final_answer` function.

Example:
Passage: Albert Einstein was born in Germany.
Triples:
[Albert Einstein:Q937] [birthplace:P19] [Germany:Q183]
Contradicting triples:
[Albert Einstein:Q937] [birthplace:P19] [Greece:Q41]

Please proceed with the task using the following inputs:
Passage: {{ passage }}
Triples:
{{ triples }}
Before you start, write a short plan about how you wil generate the contradictions.
