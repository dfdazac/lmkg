You are given an input consisting of a passage and a set of triples that reflect the information in the passage. Your task is to generate a new set of triples that contradict the input. Please follow these instructions:
- Make sure to use only identifiers of entities and predicates that exist in the knowledge graph when generating the contradicting triples.
- Make use of the functions available to you to understand the predicates and entities involved.
- Triples are specified with one triple per line, and an element in a triple is specified as [label:id] where label is a short textual label, and id is the identifier in the knowledge graph
- Only call one function at a time.
- Submit your answer by calling the `submit_final_answer` function. If an answer contains multiple triples, use a single string with new line separators.

Example:
Passage: Salah Bouchaour is a town and commune in Skikda Province in north-eastern Algeria.
Triples:
[Salah Bouchaour:Q1650111] [instance of:P31] [Communes of Algeria:Q2989398]

[Algeria:Q262] [contains administrative territorial entity:P150] [Skikda Province:Q234227]
Contradicting triples:
[Salah Bouchaour:Q1650111] [instance of:P31] [Cities of France:Q2940569]
[Skikda Province:Q234227] [country:P17] [France:Q142]
[France:Q142] [contains administrative territorial entity:P150] [Skikda Province:Q234227]
